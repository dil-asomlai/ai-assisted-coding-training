# Todo App with Atlas UI

![CI Status](https://github.com/dil-asomlai/ai-assisted-coding-training/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

A React-based Todo application built with TypeScript, Material UI, and Atlas UI components. This project demonstrates modern React development practices with proper state management, component architecture, and comprehensive testing.

## Features

- ✅ Create, read, update, and delete todo items
- ✅ Mark todos as completed
- ✅ Session persistence (todos survive page refreshes)
- ✅ Responsive design with Material UI
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ React Context for state management
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Prettier and ESLint for code quality
- ✅ Husky pre-commit hooks
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow

## Session Persistence

The app automatically saves your todos to your browser's session storage, ensuring your data persists during page refreshes within the same browser session. Key aspects:

- **Automatic saving**: Todos are saved immediately when you add, edit, or delete them
- **Session-based**: Data persists only within the current browser session (cleared when you close the browser)
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handles storage quota limits and corrupt data
- **Data validation**: Ensures stored data integrity on load
