- ...

## Tasks:

0. **Check MCP Access**
      - Confirm whether an active Atlassian MCP connections is available.
      - If no MCP connection is detected, terminate the task immediately and return: "No MCP connection. Execution stopped."
1. **Retrieve and read content**:
   - For GitHub (if provided): Use MCP to retrieve and read the GitHub issue content
   - For Jira (if provided): Use Atlassian MCP to retrieve and read the Jira ticket content
2. **Analyze relationships**: Determine if the issue/ticket has:
   - Parent issues/tickets
   - Sub-tasks or child issues
   - Links to other tickets
   - Links to documentation pages (Confluence, GitHub wiki, etc.)
   - Related issues or tickets
3. **Read all linked content**: Understand all linked or related content, including:
   - Comments and discussions
   - Confluence documentation
   - Related tickets/issues
   - Embedded links to depth 2
   - Source code context (if provided)
4. **Assess implementation readiness**: Check whether the issue/ticket contains all necessary information for a developer or agent to proceed without ambiguity

Validation & Analysis:
Review the ticket comprehensively and confirm it includes:
• A clear objective or expected outcome
• Technical context (e.g. repository, environment, API keys, etc.)
• Defined rules or constraints (e.g. autonomy, approvals, fallback process)
• References to any required documentation or external sources
• Edge cases or decision logic for non-trivial behavior
• Approval or security processes, if applicable

For any missing or unclear areas, generate a list of open questions that need clarification. Ask all the open questions qou have regardless the number of the questions. Focus on:
• Ambiguities in the ticket description
• Unclear requirements or edge cases
• Missing technical details
• Dependencies or blockers
Propose answers to the open questions and solutions for missing information based on the context, and best-practices already in place.

## Output Format:

```

2. [Question 2]
    **Proposal**: [Proposed answer 2]
...

Ticket Readiness: [Yes / No]

Recommendation:
[What should be added or changed, or confirm readiness]

Prompt for AI-assisted implementation [Add this only if the ticket is ready]:
[Prompt I can use for implementation request]
```

**Important**: If the ticket/issue is ready, explicitly state that no blockers remain.
